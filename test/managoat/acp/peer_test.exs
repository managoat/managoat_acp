defmodule Managoat.ACP.PeerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Drives a real peer against a hand-scripted agent, one frame at a time.

  The transport is the writer function the peer takes (`Managoat.ACP.Transport`):
  here it forwards whatever the peer writes to the test process, so every
  assertion is about bytes that would actually have gone down the pipe, and
  the test feeds the agent's replies back through `Peer.stdout/2`. No
  process is stubbed and nothing is global, which is what lets the suite
  run async — and is the acceptance test for the transport seam: a peer test
  that needed a sandbox stub would mean the seam was not cut.

  `Managoat.ACP.Testing.ScriptedAgent` drives whole turns; these tests want
  the individual frames, so they script by hand.
